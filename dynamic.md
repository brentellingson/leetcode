The Ultimate Dynamic Programming Roadmap
Hey guys, I've seen a lot of discussions about how to study DP in this subreddit. We went through a lot of (almost all) DP problems on leetcode and came up a study list here. I think it pretty much covers all the patterns necessary for leetcode. What's special about the list 1) goes from simpler to more complex patterns 2) categorized by state transition (explained in the video walkthrough) so if you solve the first problem in a pattern you can use a similar state transition to solve others in the list.
Here's the list and a 1.5 hour video walking through each pattern and solving a question for each pattern: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9k31KcQmS_U
Hope it's helpful to you!

## Group 1 (warmup):

Basic questions to get a feel of DP.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/climbing-stairs/ in linear time
* https://leetcode.com/problems/n-th-tribonacci-number/ in linear time
* https://leetcode.com/problems/perfect-squares/ (maybe)

# Group 2 (linear sequence, linear time, constant transition):

Dp solution requires us to solve the sub problem on every prefix of the array. A prefix of the array is a subarray from 0 to i for some i.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/min-cost-climbing-stairs/ in linear time
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-time-to-make-rope-colorful/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/decode-ways/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-for-tickets/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/solving-questions-with-brainpower/

# Group 3 (on grids):

Dp table will have the same dimensions as grid, the state at cell i,j will be related to the grid at cell i,j.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/unique-paths-ii/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-path-sum/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/count-square-submatrices-with-all-ones/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/maximal-square/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/dungeon-game/

# Group 4 (two sequences, O(NM) style):

Dp[i][j] is some value related to the problem solved on prefix of sequence 1 with length i, and prefix on sequence 2 with length j.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-common-subsequence/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/uncrossed-lines/ (longest common subsequence)
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-ascii-delete-sum-for-two-strings/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/edit-distance/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/distinct-subsequences/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/shortest-common-supersequence/

# Group 5 (Interval dp):

Dp problem is solved on every single interval (subarray) of the array

* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-palindromic-subsequence/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/stone-game-vii/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/palindromic-substrings/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/minimum-cost-tree-from-leaf-values/ (hard to see interval)
* https://leetcode.com/problems/strange-printer/ (hard)
* https://leetcode.com/problems/burst-balloons/ (hard)

# Group 6 (linear sequence transition like N2 Longest Increasing Subsequence)

Dp problem is solved on every prefix of the array. Transition is from every index j < i.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/count-number-of-teams/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-subsequence/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-array-for-maximum-sum/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/largest-sum-of-averages/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/filling-bookcase-shelves/

# Group 7 (knapsack-like)

Dp state is similar to the classical knapsack problem.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/partition-equal-subset-sum/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/number-of-dice-rolls-with-target-sum/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/combination-sum-iv/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/ones-and-zeroes/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/coin-change-ii/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/target-sum/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/last-stone-weight-ii/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/profitable-schemes/ (hard)

# Group 8 (topological sort with graphs. advanced, optional)

Solve dp on all subgraphs that are connected to each node

* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-string-chain/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/longest-increasing-path-in-a-matrix/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/course-schedule-iii/

# Group 9 (dp on trees. advanced, optional)

Solve dp problem on all subtrees.

* https://leetcode.com/problems/house-robber-iii/
* https://leetcode.com/problems/binary-tree-cameras/
